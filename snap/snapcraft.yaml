    Grisbi is a free personal accounting software.

    Grisbi provides novice users a simple to use program that requires little or no 
    reading of documentation, while allowing advanced users more advanced use by 
    reading the manual (entirely in French). It is presented as "personal accounting",
    but is particularly suited to small and medium-sized associations.

  grade: devel # must be 'stable' to release into candidate/stable channels
